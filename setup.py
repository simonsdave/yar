# Execute the command line
#
#   python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar
#
# from the same directory as setup.py which will generate
# the file yar/yar-V.N.tar.gz where V.N is the version number
# used as the version argument to setup() below.
#
# To install the archieve just run pip using something like
#
#   pip install yar-V.N.tar.gz
#
# Note - if you're running pip install inside a Docker container
# then it probably means you got the archive into the container
# using a Dockerfile's ADD command. The ADD command decompresses
# the archive and extracts all files. This is fine. Just run the
# pip command on the directory to which the files are extracted.
# Probably something like this for yar:
#
#   pip install yar-1.0
#
# :TODO: add commentry about which version of setuptools should
# be used.

    # And finally, yar.key_store.design_docs shouldn't be in packages.
    #
    # Wow, that's A LOT of stuff that should be done differently. What's up?
    # It's all about how setuptools or distutils (boy I struggle to understand
    # the Python packaging world!) handles (or really doesn't handle) packaging
    # and install of non-Python files. Design documents for the key store are
    # json documents and it was these files that I wanted to package up.
    # So what exactly was the problem?  As long as MANIFEST.in was around
    # and referenced the design documents (see above) running sdist:
    #
    #   python setup.py sdist
    #
    # did indeed package the design documents in the sdist generated egg
    # (yar/dist/yar-*.*.tar.gz). Yes this part worked! The problem came when
    # pip installing the egg:
    #
    #   pip install ./yar-*.*.tar.gz
    #
    # as per the docs @ http://pythonhosted.org//setuptools/setuptools.html#including-data-files
    # creds.json was put in sys.prefix by pip but what we wanted and expected
    # was for it to be put in the same directory as the yar.key_store package.
    #
    # After many hours of frustrating reading I came to the conclusion
    # that everyone would like things to work as I have described but it doesn't
    # and folks are just hacking around the problem. Thought I was off down a
    # promising path by using site.getsitepackages() to construct an install
    # path that would be used with the data_files statement. Something like:
    #
    #   site.getsitepackages()
    #
    # So what was the problem the the site approach? Works fine on Ubuntu but
    # site.getsitepackages() isn't available on Mac OS X (with the default 2.7
    # Python version).
    #
    # Some facts ... on Ubuntu 12.04:
    #
    #   yar installs to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/yar/__init__.pyc
    #   sys.prefix is /usr
    #   site.getsitepackages() returns:
    #       ['/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages']
    #
    # on Mac OS X Maverics:
    #
    #   sys.prefix is /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7
    #
    # The sol'n path I choose was to rename the .json files as .py files even
    # though they aren't actually .py files but just use them like .json files.
